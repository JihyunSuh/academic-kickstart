abstract = "In four experiments, participants estimated the sizes of target objects that were 
either out of reach, or that could be reached by a tool (a stylus or laser pointer). Objects 
reachable with the aid of a tool were perceived to be smaller than identical objects without a 
tool. Participants' responses to questioning rule out demand characteristics as an 
explanation. This new size illusion may reflect a direct impact of tool use on perceived size, 
or it may stem from the effects of tool use on perceived distance. Both possibilities support 
action specific accounts of perception."
